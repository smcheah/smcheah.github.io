                    Recent Computer Science graduate, majoring in robotics and cyber-physical computing with interests in IoT, Robotics and Web
                    Development looking for new opportunities for a career in tech.

                <p>
                    Through my major, I have experienced working in team projects involving agile methodologies to create programs on embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

                    Currently im doing a full stack web development bootcamp as I wanted to learn a bit more about the trending technologies that are used in production today and its actually been quite a bit of fun because its so visual and I feel like that’s very rewarding me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’d like to work within the IT industry as I really enjoy using technology creatively, mainly to find new ways to solve problems but currently, I’d like to just be able to expand my skills and develop my learning a bit more. There are so many directions you could take in technology and I’m pretty curious to find out more about it.
